Start to remove low quality data.

Warning: There were 257360 unreadable chromosome ids. Identifier for a chromosome should be a number.

257360 low quality lines were removed.

Determine phylogenetic tree based on SNP data with a VCF, a HapMap, a Simple SNP or a GDS file

Version: 20140701

Usage:
	snphylo.sh -v VCF_file [-p Maximum_PLCS (5)] [-c Minimum_depth_of_coverage (5)]|-H HapMap_file [-p Maximum_PNSS (5)]|-s Simple_SNP_file [-p Maximum_PNSS (5)]|-d GDS_file [-l LD_threshold (0.1)] [-m MAF_threshold (0.1)] [-M Missing_rate (0.1)] [-o Outgroup_sample_name] [-P Prefix_of_output_files (snphylo.output)] [-b [-B The_number_of_bootstrap_samples (100)]] [-a The_number_of_the_last_autosome (22)] [-r] [-A] [-h]

Options:
	-A: Perform multiple alignment by MUSCLE
	-b: Perform (non-parametric) bootstrap analysis and generate a tree
	-h: Show help and exit
	-r: Skip the step removing low quality data (-p and -c option are ignored).

Acronyms:
	PLCS: The percent of Low Coverage Sample
	PNSS: The percent of Sample which has no SNP information
	LD: Linkage Disequilibrium
	MAF: Minor Allele Frequency

Simple SNP File Format:
	#Chrom	Pos	SampleID1	SampleID2	SampleID3	...
	1	1000	A	A	T	...
	1	1002	G	C	G	...
	...
	2	2000	G	C	G	...
	2	2002	A	A	T	...
	...

Error: There are too small number of SNP data in the file (snphylo.output.filtered.vcf)!
Please restart this script with different parameter values (-p and/or -c).
